# Domains JSON file
The way to register a subdomain is through a pull request. For example, to register `example.is-a.dev`, you would need to create a file named `domains/example.json`.

## Filename
**Note**: You can put `.` (dots) in your filename for registering a sub-subdomain (`blog.example.is-a.dev`) however, each of the following criteria must be valid for all part of your subdomain

The filename must pass the following criteria:

- Must be alpha-numeric in lowercase with dashes as seperators.
- Must be more than 2 characters long.
- Must have a `.json` file extension
