# Register your is-a.dev subdomain using the is-a-dev Dashboard

## Login to the dashboard
First login to the [dashboard](https://manage.is-a.dev/) using your GitHub account.

## Registering your subdomain
On the left hand side, click on the button that says Register with a keyboard icon.

Then follow the steps to register your subdomain.

It will fork the [is-a-dev/register](https://github.com/is-a-dev/register) repository, assuming you haven't done that already and it will create a pull request for you.

Finally, you'll have to wait for a maintainer to merge it, which should not take too long.
