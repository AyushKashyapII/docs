## Vercel and Netlify
You will encounter an SSL certificate issue when using Vercel and Netlify. Neither service will work with our domains. It is recommended to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), [Railway](https://railway.app) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) instead.
