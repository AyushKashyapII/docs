When you create your hashnode blog, hashnode provides a free `hashnode.dev` subdomain for you. However, you can set up your own `is-a.dev` subdomain.

In this guide, you will learn how to accomplish this.

1. Log in to your Hashnode account.

2. Click on your **avatar** at the bottom-left corner of the page on **desktop** or top-right corner on **mobile**.

5. Go to your fork of the `is-a-dev/register` repository, edit your subdomain's JSON file, make sure you remove any old records, then add this:
```json
"CNAME": "hashnode.network"
```

Once done, your hashnode blog is setup to use your subdomain, all you have to do is wait sometime for the DNS to propogate. These changes could take from 1 hour to around 48 hours, so please be patient, It'll most likely be ready within a hour.
