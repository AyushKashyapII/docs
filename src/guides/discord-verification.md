### Edit your domain file

!!!
You must already own an is-a.dev domain to do this.
!!!

Edit your domain file (`domains/your-domain.json`) and **add this snippet after the `records` key**:

```json
"services": {
   "discord": "your-discord-verification-string"
}
```

Please remember to add a comma after the `records` key's closing brace!

## Configuration

After your pull request has been merged, repeat steps 1â€“5 and press the `Verify` button.
If it shows any error such as `Unable to verify your domain`, try waiting a few minutes (sometimes up to 24 hours) as the DNS might not have propagated yet.
